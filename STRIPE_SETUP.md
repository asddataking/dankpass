# 💳 Stripe Premium Upgrade Flow

## Overview

Your DankPass app now has a complete premium subscription flow using Stripe! Users can upgrade to premium from multiple places throughout the app.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Stripe Checkout Integration**
- ✅ Stripe API configured in `src/lib/stripe.ts`
- ✅ Checkout session creation endpoint at `/api/stripe/checkout`
- ✅ Webhook handler at `/api/stripe/webhook` (for subscription events)
- ✅ User's email automatically passed to Stripe

### 2. **Premium Page** (`/premium`)
- Single pricing plan:
  - **Premium**: $7/month
- Uses real Stripe Price ID from environment variables
- Integrates with Stack Auth to get user email
- Shows benefits, FAQ, and money-back guarantee
- Working "Subscribe" buttons that redirect to Stripe Checkout

### 3. **Upgrade Prompt After First Upload**
- Beautiful modal that appears 1.5 seconds after first upload
- Shows potential bonus points (1.5x multiplier)
- Lists premium benefits
- Only shows once per session
- Can be dismissed or redirects to premium page
- Located in `src/components/UpgradePrompt.tsx`

### 4. **Premium CTAs Throughout App**

**Dashboard:**
- "Go Premium" button in header (if not premium)

**Profile Page:**
- Prominent premium upgrade card (if not premium)
- Shows pricing and benefits

**Upload Page:**
- Upgrade prompt modal after first upload
- Gentle, non-intrusive timing

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Stripe Keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... or sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_... or pk_test_...

# Stripe Price ID

## 💰 Stripe Checkout Process

### When user clicks "Subscribe":

1. **Frontend** calls `/api/stripe/checkout` with:
   ```json
   {
     "priceId": "price_...",
     "customerEmail": "user@example.com",
     "metadata": {
       "userId": "user_abc123",
       "userEmail": "user@example.com"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Backend** creates Stripe Checkout session:
   - Mode: `subscription`
   - Success URL: `/dashboard?success=true`
   - Cancel URL: `/premium?canceled=true`

3. **User** is redirected to Stripe Checkout page

4. **After payment**:
   - Success → Redirected to dashboard
   - Cancel → Returned to premium page
   - Webhook updates user's premium status
